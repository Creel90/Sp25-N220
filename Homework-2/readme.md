## Homework-2

### Weekly Recap

I learned many good shortcuts I can use for VS Code Editor to make coding easier and faster. 
1. Type h1, hit enter and it will put out our header tags.
2. To create emojis using Windows click Window Symbol + Period.

_Another important thing I learned was how to publish my repository on GitHub which was something I never knew but will save me a lot of time in the future instead of having to go back and forth from VS to GitHub I can just use this link._

**Learning about the console messages is something that I definitly feel I need more practice with to better understand their purpose and how to properly use them to my benefit.**
