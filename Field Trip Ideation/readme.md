### Project Summary

This project showcases the sculpture *Montana Mother* by Charles Marion Russell, located at the Eiteljorg Museum in Indianapolis, Indiana. The sculpture features a mother bear and her cubs perched on a tree branch, symbolizing protection, maternal care, and the spirit of the American West. I chose this artifact because, as a mother myself, I deeply connect with its message of nurturing and protection. The tender relationship between the bear and her cubs reminds me of the bond I share with my own children. Russell's work not only captures the beauty of wildlife but also reflects the powerful emotions of motherhood. This website aims to educate users about the sculpture's artistic and historical significance while engaging them through interactive and multimedia features.
