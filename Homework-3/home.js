const radius = 5; 

let area = Math.PI * Math.pow(5,2); 

let perimeter = 2 * Math.PI * radius; 

console.log("The area of the circle is:", area);

console.log("The perimeter of the circle is:", perimeter);

//I used const for the radius as it is not a value that will change.

//I used let for the area and perimeter as it was going to be changing the value due to the mathmatical equation.
