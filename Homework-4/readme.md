## Homework-4

### Weekly Recap

1. This assignment took a little more effort than I last weeks. I had to go through all our past lessons and videos to get a better understanding and will be reaching out to tutor to try to get a better understanding of this so I do not have to go back and forth as much hopefully.
2. At first my test scores page kept having repeat of my list so I had to add **scoreList.innerHTML = "";** to clear the extra list items.
3. I kept redoing my instrument list html and js file as I recieved no errors or no outputs in the console.
4. I have found that _W3 Schools_ is a very resourcful site that can help give you a better understanding of all sorts of code. If I cannot find something in the notes or past video I can go there and search for what I am looking for such as _img.alt_ and it will show me several examples and let me practice.
