## Homework-3

### Weekly Recap

This week was much harder than last week!

I had to do a lot of research using w3 schools and rewatching the class video to get a better understanding of how to get the mathmatical equations to work.

For _example_ on Home we had to write out R squared and to do that in code we had to use **Math.pow(5,2)** to make it work.

We also had to use strings such as 
1. .length to determine whether the password consisted of 8 or more characters
2. .startsWith (.position) to find out if the password started with a space.

My biggest **struggle** this week was the _store.js_ I could not figure out how to make the _discountedTotalAfterTax_ to work correctly, so will need to work on that more!
